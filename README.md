# JAVA GUI EXERCISE
_What did I learn with this exercise?_

* Basics of Java programming language. Although I already know how to write code in a bunch of other languages, it is always nice to learn a new one and there are new or different characteristics.
* Java is the go to when you have to create a gui desktop application as it is cross platform and has strong libraries for the task
* Java is the kind of language that I personally have to use with its API opened, as it has so many libraries and it is quite a high level language for myself. These already built functions are great when it comes to creating an application "fast" without having to bother about low level stuff which we always sometimes need.
* Although this application is knid of useless, it covers the basics of GUIs.
* It is nice to write some code in a Object Oriented language, as I personally consider them quite cute and childish compared to C, for example.

_Conclusion_

* Java is an interesting programming language and I will continue exploring some more advanced features it provides such as thread programming or the Spring library which is often used in companies.
* I will definately use it when I have to create a desktop gui application.
